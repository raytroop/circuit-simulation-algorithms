
Thank you for downloading the Python simulator scripts. We hope you will learn some useful things about analog simulators and perhaps be inspired to develop something on 
your own! We will keep these codes current and incorporate bug fixes and various improvements as time passes, so check back often for the latest release!

The Python language is very helpful when trying to do some basic algorithm development. It is available on virtually all platforms and extraordinary easy to use. 
However, if you want to develop fast and memory efficient codes there are better languages out there. Our preference is more towards C/C++ for production ready versions of
these kind of algorithms.

A few words of caution and encouragement:

1) The codes were developed on the Spyder 3.3.6 platform (Python 3.7) that comes with the Anaconda environment.

2) The codes are not optimized for speed or memory efficiency in any way so simulations can be really slow as some of the examples show.

3) The basic idea of distributing the codes is to showcase basic analog simulation algorithms and we hope the code is clear enough for this purpose. 
   This means that the error trappings are very sparse and it is likely that attempting to use the codes on netlists other than provided in this distribution
   will result in bugs. Please, shoot us an email and we will take a look as time permits. The side benefit is the reader gets to get his/her
   hands 'dirty' and can sit and play with the code and suggest fixes. 


Comments are highly welcome!
